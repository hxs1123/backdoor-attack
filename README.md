I am an AI hacker, and currently, my research focuses on backdoor attacks and defenses in artificial intelligence. In this regard, I am committed to sharing knowledge related to artificial intelligence models and artificial intelligence security knowledge. I hope that my work can be of some help to you.

It is worth stating that I have referred to some code from this academic "big shot".
